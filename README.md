## Description

This repository contains my solution for the Module 5 Challenge - "This-is-the-task-board-to-end-all-task-boards"

In order for work to show what I can do, I used JavaScript to:

- Added a function which allows a user to add multiple employees to display on the page.

- Added a function which takes in the generated array of employees and logs the average salary and number of employees to the console.

- Added a function which takes in the generated array of employees, randomly selects one employee, and uses a template literal to log their full name to the console.

You can find my deployed page here:

and my repository page here:

Here is a picture of my deployed page:

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Each section on this page was laid out based on Semantic HTML styling and tags, as I deleted non-semantic HTML elements. I also ensured my css file contained all appropriate styling elements so my version of the webpage mirrored the UT Challenge source file, when rendered on a browser.

I used Chrome console (inspect) to ensure my edits, adjustments, changes, and tweaks rendered correctly.

## Credits

Credit to Jasper Garcia, my son, who helps me troubleshoot when I am stuck - however, I wrote all my own JavaScript. I was able to ask him questions to clarify, and he prompted and challenged me to take breaks and allow my mind to process the solutions which were brewing.

When stuck, I referenced the following sites:

- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/>

- <https://stackoverflow.com/>

- <https://google.com/>

- <https://bing.com/>

I referenced code (HTML and CSS) from the UT provided lessons, however, I wrote all my own changes, edits, tweaks, and versions of my webpage, html, and css.

No outside sources of text, html, or css were copied into my work.

I commented and committed to my repo heavily.

I was able to deploy without issue, once I copied all HTML and css files properly.
