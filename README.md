## Description

This repository contains my solution for the Module 5 Challenge - "This-is-the-task-board-to-end-all-task-boards"

In order for my work to show what I can do, I used HTML and JavaScript to:

- Added a function which lists project tasks, displayed in columns representing the task progress state (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed)

-- Each task is color coded to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline (yellow) or is overdue (red)

-- When I click on the button to define a new task, I can enter the title, description and deadline date for the new task into a modal dialog.

-- When I click the save button for that task, the properties for that task are saved in localStorage.

-- When I drag a task to a different progress column, then the task's progress state is updated accordingly and will stay in the new column after refreshing.

-- When I click the delete button for a task, the task is removed from the task board and will not be added back after refreshing.

-- When I refresh the page, the saved tasks persist.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

My final version of the webpage mirrors the UT Challenge source file, acceptance criteria, rubric, and Sample gif when rendered on a browser.

I used Chrome's console (inspect) to ensure my edits, adjustments, changes, and tweaks rendered correctly.

## Credits

Credit to Jasper Garcia, my son, who helps me troubleshoot when I am stuck - however, I wrote all my own JavaScript and HTML updates. 
I was able to ask him questions to clarify, and he prompted and challenged me to take breaks and allow my mind to process the solutions which were brewing.

When stuck (and I was stuck a lot), I referenced the following sites:

- <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/>

- <https://stackoverflow.com/>

- <https://www.taskade.com/>

- <https://google.com/>

- <https://bing.com/>

I referenced code (HTML and CSS) from the UT provided lessons, however, I wrote all my own changes, edits, tweaks, and versions of my webpage, html, and styles.

I commented and committed to my repo heavily.

I was able to deploy without issue, once I copied all HTML and css files properly.
